Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power - the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as the Ring is entrusted to his care. He must leave his home and make a perilous journey across the realms of Middle-earth to the Crack of Doom, deep inside the territories of the Dark Lord.

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.",

Key FeaturesOver 90 practical recipes to help you write clean and maintainable JavaScript codes with the latest ES8Leverage the power of leading web frameworks like Node and React to build modern web appsFeatures comprehensive coverage of tools and techniques needed to create multi-platform apps with JavaScriptBook Description JavaScript has evolved into a language that you can use on any platform. Modern JavaScript Web Development Cookbook is a perfect blend of solutions for traditional JavaScript development and modern areas that developers have lately been exploring with JavaScript. This comprehensive guide teaches you how to work with JavaScript on servers, browsers, mobile phones and desktops. You will start by exploring the new features of ES8. You will then move on to learning the use of ES8 on servers (with Node.js), with the objective of producing services and microservices and dealing with authentication and CORS. Once you get accustomed to ES8, you will learn to apply it to browsers using frameworks, such as React and Redux, which interact through Ajax with services. You will then understand the use of a modern framework to develop the UI. In addition to this, development for mobile devices with React Native will walk you through the benefits of creating native apps, both for Android and iOS. Finally, youâ€™ll be able to apply your new-found knowledge of server-side and client-side tools to develop applications with Electron. What you will learnUse the latest features of ES8 and learn new ways to code with JavaScriptDevelop server-side services and microservices with Node.jsLearn to do unit testing and to debug your codeBuild client-side web applications using React and ReduxCreate native mobile applications for Android and iOS with React NativeWrite desktop applications with ElectronWho this book is for This book is for developers who want to explore the latest JavaScript features, frameworks, and tools for building complete mobile, desktop and web apps, including server and client-side code.

It is there Harry was tortured and beaten and witnessed countless atrocities including the murder of his best friend, Curly. Only problem, Harry can't seem to erase the event from his memories, and he sure can't seem to forgive his captors for the barbaric things which took place during his imprisonment. Now, sixty years later, he's angry and on a mission to sue the Obuchi government for an apology. Since his liberation in August, 1945, Harry's life has been spiraling downward, highlighted by one failed relationship after another, five marriages in total, all marred by battering and cruelty. For Harry the suit is more than a legal means to even the score, it is the last opportunity to lay blame for his own failings. Only days from death, Harry's litigation appears to be lapsing with his demise unless he can convince one of the other four Omori survivors to collaborate in the litigation. Unfortunately, all four despise him and won't enjoin the suit. Furthermore, the U.S. government is siding with the Japanese in hopes of winning trade concessions, and vows to fight Harry to the end. The government's legal team is led by none other than Harry's bastard son, Harold, turning the legal battle into a nasty family affair. All appears to be going adversely against the old veteran. Enter Tinker, an aspiring author in the throws of a literary dry spell. She is searching for the one great story (oddly, a non-fiction piece) to turn her fledgling career around. It is the television interview with Harry by Larry King, however, that motivates her into journeying to Texas for the annual USS Houston survivors' reunion and a shot at the rights to Harry's story. A victim of childhood physical abuse herself, Tinker's past soon becomes intertwined with Harry's, the battering both experienced providing common ground. During the course of the interview, Tinker discovers the dark secrets surrounding Harry and his seeming culpability in the deaths of five crewmates. It is this connection which has created a schism between Harry and the last of the Omori survivors. In the end, Tinker must not only reunite the five Omori brothers, she must also come to terms with her own past and forgive her estranged father.",

Subsequent reports revealed that the prince had killed up to thirty Taliban insurgents in directing at least three air strikes, and that he had helped Gurkha troops repel a ground attack of Taliban insurgents using a machine gun. On February 29, Prince Harry was withdrawn from the country with distinction via a covert SAS deployment. This is the amazing story of the first British royal to serve his country in 25 years and his 10 heroic weeks of combat.",

            "description": "Seminar paper from the year 2008 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 2, University of Frankfurt (Main), language: English, abstract: Harry Potter is a heptalogy of fantasy novels by the English author Joanne K. Rowling about an adolescent boy named Harry Potter, first published in England in 1997. Harry Potter attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a boarding school for young wizards and witches. Up to his eleventh birthday his cruel relatives, the Dursleys, have raised the orphaned Harry. On this day he learns that he is a wizard and has been invited to attend Hogwarts. The story is mostly set on the school premises, with each of the seven volumes describing a school year at Hogwarts and a year of Harry's growing-up. The main topic is Harry Potter's fight against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort who killed Harry's parents when he was still an infant. Throughout the story the Dark Lord Voldemort gains more and more power and tries to kill Harry several times. In Hallows the climax is reached and the final battle between Harry and Lord Voldemort which will decide the future of the wizarding world. The fight of good versus evil is one of the oldest topics of mankind. Starting with the original sin in the Garden of Eden this fight has dominated moral concepts of the Christian world ever since. This paper presents an analysis of how good and evil are portrayed and presented in the Harry Potter series. First, there is a description of Christian motifs in the series and how these motifs can be compared to certain characters in the books. Second, 'good' characters such as Harry's close friends Ron and Hermione, and Harry's mentor, Professor Dumbledore, are described and characterised as to why they are part of the 'good'. Third, the 'evil' opponents Draco Malfoy and the evil Dark Lord Voldemort are analysed as to how they exhibit 'evil' behaviour. The last chapter deals with the question of whether Harry Potter is 'good' or 'evil' as he does not always act as an exemplary student.",

From his earliest public appearances as a mischievous redheaded toddler, Prince Harry has captured the hearts of royal enthusiasts around the world. In Harry, Britain's leading expert on the young royals offers an in-depth look at the wayward prince turned national treasure. Nicholl sheds new light on growing up royal, Harry's relationship with his mother, his troubled youth and early adulthood, and how his military service in Afghanistan inspired him to create his legacy, the Invictus Games. Harry: Life, Loss, and Love features interviews with friends, those who have worked with the prince, and former Palace aides.
